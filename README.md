This the the repo for my fullstack restaurant app tutorial located on [here](https://medium.com/@nicholaslatham1999/full-stack-application-with-go-gin-react-and-mongodb-37b63ef71133)

When I was learning how to build a web server in Go with mongodb, I couldn't find a good tutorial, so I decided to make my own so others would hopefully have an easier time.
