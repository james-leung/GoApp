Todo list:

1. Frontend: migrate to Next.JS for SSR. Serve html from backend
2. Add JWT middleware for authentication
3. Dockerisation. Add new docker containers for new entities such as users
4. Add streaming service (e.g. RabbitMQ)

This the the repo for my fullstack restaurant app tutorial located on [here](https://medium.com/@nicholaslatham1999/full-stack-application-with-go-gin-react-and-mongodb-37b63ef71133)

When I was learning how to build a web server in Go with MongoDB, I couldn't find a good tutorial, so I decided to make my own so others would hopefully have an easier time.
